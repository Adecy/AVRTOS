# Different metrics on the code

## Example sizes

Script [`scripts/metrics-example-sizes.sh`](../../scripts/metrics-example-sizes.sh) compute flash 
and ram usage of the examples and store the results in [docs/metrics/exsizes.txt](exsizes.txt).

## TODO:

Idea would be to generate metrics for all targets and in release/debug mode and
qemu/real board.
